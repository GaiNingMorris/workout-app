🚀 How to Run the App
1. Install Dependencies
bash
npm install
This installs:

Electron 31.2.0
NeDB 1.8.0
2. Start the App
bash
npm start
3. First Run
The app will:

Launch in a desktop window
Look for old workout-data.json (if migrating from v1.x)
Automatically migrate to NeDB format
Create workout-data/ folder with database files
Initialize default user profile and settings
4. Verify Everything Works
Go to Today page → should show correct workout for today (check day of week)
Go to Schedule page → should show 7-day plan
Go to Goals page → should show progress tracking
Go to Settings page → verify rest timers (120s/90s)
Complete a test workout → verify it saves to Logs page
📋 Testing Checklist
Basic Functionality
 App launches without errors
 All 6 tabs render correctly (Today, Schedule, Goals, Logs, Settings, Groups)
 Demo images load (or show placeholder if missing)
 Rest timer counts down between sets
 Navigation between tabs works
Today Page

 Sunday shows: Rest day message
Workout Completion
 Can mark warm-up exercises as done

 Finish Workout button saves to database
 Workout appears in Logs page after completion
Progression System
 Weight increases after successful workout
 Weight stays same after failed workout
 Weight decreases after 2 consecutive failures
 Push-up level advances after 2 successful workouts
Consecutive success rule: weight-based exercises require 3 consecutive successful workouts by default before the next weight increase; both required consecutive count and per-step increment (default 1.5 lb) are configurable in Settings.
Goals Page
 Can add bodyweight entry
 Bodyweight history displays correctly
 Unlock progress shows (bar hangs, chin-ups)
 Push-up progression displays current level
 Deload countdown shows weeks remaining
Settings
 Can change rest timers
 Can change deload interval
 Settings save and persist
 Export Data button downloads JSON
 Factory Reset confirms and works
Data Persistence
 Close app and reopen → data still there
 Workout logs persist
 Settings persist
 User profile persists
🐛 Known Issues to Watch For
Potential Issues
Async timing: Some functions use await - if data doesn't load, check console
Image paths: Demo images may not load if src/assets/exercises/ doesn't exist
First run: May take a moment to create database files
Migration: If old JSON has unexpected format, migration might fail (check console)
How to Debug
Open DevTools: F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I
Check Console tab for errors
Check Network tab if images aren't loading
Check Application → IndexedDB (NeDB uses files, not IndexedDB, but shows storage)
🔧 If Something Doesn't Work
App won't start
bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
Migration fails
bash
# Manually trigger migration by renaming:
mv workout-data.json.backup workout-data.json
# Then restart app
npm start
Database errors
bash
# Delete and recreate databases:
rm -rf workout-data/
npm start
# Note: This deletes all workout data!
Still broken?
Check console errors
Review main.js IPC handlers
Check src/preload.js API exposure
Verify NeDB is installed: npm list nedb
📝 Customization Options
Change Default Values
In src/utils/helpers.js:

Starting weight: Line in defaultData() → currentWeight: 262
Target weight: Line in defaultData() → targetWeight: 165
